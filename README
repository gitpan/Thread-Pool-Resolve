README for Thread::Pool::Resolve

Sub-class of Thread::Pool that creates a special pool of threads for resolving
log files (any text file or stream of which the first field is an IP number).
Can be used for real-time asynchronous logging or for batch resolving of log
files.

                         *** A note of CAUTION ***

This module only functions on Perl versions 5.8.0-RC3 and later.  And then
only when threads are enabled with -Dusethreads.  It is of no use with any
version of Perl before 5.8.0-RC3 or without threads enabled.
